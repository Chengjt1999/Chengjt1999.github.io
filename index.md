## About Me

I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the School of Intelligence Science and Technology, Peking University (北京大学智能学院), working with Prof. Song-Chun Zhu. Now, I am also a researcher at the machine learning lab at Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI, 北京通用人工智能研究院). 

I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Internet of Things Engineering at the School of Data Science and Engineering, South China Normal University, and supervised by Associate Professor Xiaoyu Tang. I also serve as a member of the RIS LAB(Robotic and Intelligent Sensing Lab), where I contribute to research projects focusing on Robotic sensing and Intelligent Transportation.
