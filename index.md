## About Me

I am currently an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Internet of Things Engineering at the School of Data Science and Engineering, South China Normal University (华南师范大学数据科学与工程学院), and supervised by Associate Professor Xiaoyu Tang. I also serve as a member of the Robotic and Intelligent Sensing Laboratory (RIS LAB, 机器人与智能感知实验室), where I contribute to research projects focusing on Robotic sensing and Intelligent Transportation.
